# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Frank
Minute: Vlad

Mark: Pass

#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: Agenda could be worked more out in detailed subtopics. Agenda should contain the sprint review, planning and retrospective more. Also keep the naming consistent.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: The notes are are clear and complete but could be in md and a bit nicer structured.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: Frank you had the lead but there was more possibility to intervene and keep the meeting structure. Overall good effort but could be better so all agenda points get covered more efficiently. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The team goes its own way covering all important things and discussing all things that are important. Lucca you are not really participating a lot in the discussion try to do this more. This kind of feedback is recurring each week and is becoming a problem. Athmosphere is good in the group.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: The app has basic progress and looks on track. Still a lot to do so don't let the pace drop. HCI would be good to do this week.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good

Feedback: Seems like everyone does around the same amount but assign goals to people and track their progress to really hold people accountable. This can be done in the agenda.
