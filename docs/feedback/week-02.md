# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Calin
Minute: Duco

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Very solid chair and minute taker. Keep this up each week and you are fine for this component! Make sure the minute taker also puts in the notes taken on Gitlab as well!


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: Timing was not yet on point but template and content were used good. Try to look all a bit more into the assignment so you can start faster with actual discussion then everyone getting on the same line. 


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You started out a bit awkwardly but got the hang of it when the real discussion started. You were in control but were not taking over the whole meeting. Everything got almost covered, when in time need the right things were prioritized. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good/Very Good

Feedback: You were leading the meeting so that was very good. Athmosphere was very constructive and everyone was heared. 
* Frank: You were very silent during the meeting. Your input needs to be heared more. Either you need to speak more or the team needs to tone down to give you a chance. Discuss and act accordingly. 
* Lucca: You were not really up-to-date with everything. This needs needs some drastic changing in the upcoming weeks to not become a problem.
--> These are no problems (yet) or anything against any of you. I try to raise this as early on and as clear as possible just so you can improve and no problems arrise from this latter in the project. 

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good/Very Good

Feedback: It seems like you were all on the same line so that was good. The other meeting without me really helped for this. I don't know if you were present Lucca but you seemed not really up to date as mentioned in the attitude section. 

#### Overall

Very solid meeting. Some improvement points but for sure on the good way!
