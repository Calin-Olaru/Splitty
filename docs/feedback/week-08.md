# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Lucca
Minute: Calin

Mark: Pass

#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Agenda could be worked more out in detailed subtopics. Agenda should contain the sprint review, planning and retrospective more. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: Last week meeting notes are good enough but not amazing. Could be worked out more.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You kept track of the time pretty good. When the group did not listen you could be a bit more harsh to continue but overall pretty good job.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: The attitude is oke but you can feel that Lucca and Duco does not know that much about the application as the rest which sometimes leads to small frustrations but they take it up pretty friendly. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: Progress seems good but last weekend evaluation got me scared. Make sure the basic requirements are done before starting others. This is super important in these last 2 weeks. Prioritize these please.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good

Feedback: The work distribution seems to be oke. It is clear however that Lucca does just the bare minimum for the course while others try to do more.
