# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Vlad
Minute: Lucca

Mark: Pass

#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: Agenda could be worked more out in detailed subtopics. Agenda should contain the sprint review, planning and retrospective more. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Notes are complete and well structured. Great job!


#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: There was no real lead in the meeting but it felt like it also was not really necessary. Time could be used more wisely. Calin kept the meeting going more then you Vlad that shouldn't be the case. If time permits then I suggest 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Overall smooth and nice meeting covering everything that needs to be done. Lucca you were again way too silent, participate more in discussion.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: It was a bit rushed at the end. This is an important part of the meeting to show me each week the progress, try to scheduele more time for this. Overall the app looks good but there is still a lot of work to do. 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Very good that you talked about work distribution and planning. Strong points Vlad and Calin. Work this out further! Duco did not reach his weeks goals. Add these goals of the week and the successes of previous weeks to the agenda to hold people accountable.
