# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Victor
Minute: Frank

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient/Good

Feedback: The agenda could be done way more extensive. Making some subpoints in advance to the main discussion points would lead to a more structured meeting. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: The notes capture everything that is mentioned so that is good but please process them a bit after the meeting to keep everything shorter and make it a .md file. 


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good/Excellent

Feedback: Very solid leading. Kept focus while letting others talk!


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Everyone was active in the meeting. Frank you should be way more talkative in the meeting. This is going on since the beginning so really try to be more active before this might become a problem. I can see you are very knowledgable about programming about the comments you do make. More of these could help the team. Atmosphere was super good, great work enviroment. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: Product looks good and everything is on track but nothing more. To go to very good you could connect it to databases and do some styling (better to do throughout the weeks).


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good/Very Good

Feedback: All students work equally on the product. Lucca this is recurring feedback but you keep lacking in knowing everything what is going on in the project. Try to really catch up because it keep recurring each week. You're active and working well on the project, but seem to lack what happens in lectures and what is the core objective.
