# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Duco
Minute: Victor

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Duco, you lead the meeting well. In charge but not too much. Victor you were taking notes pretty heavily. Try to not be too busy so you can still paticipate in the discussion. 


#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The agenda was not much filled in. Take more time to write out what things you want to discuss. This will help a lot in the meeting. You need to follow the template (as you do) but you can make some changes as well and add some stuff if you want to. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: A md file is prefered but a pdf is fine. The notes are super well. Only think I can think of is to add a small summary on top summarizing the most important things, added after the meeting. For the rest the notes are concise and clear and capture the important things. 


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Duco, you lead the meeting well. In charge but not too much. Covered all points of the agenda in a logical order and prioritized well.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Ownership of the meeting was there. Everyone was active and came with a lot of ideas, Victor you need to be a bit more active but that was maybe because of the note taking. Everyone came with ideas and everyone listened to eachother. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: For the first week the thing you had looked reasonable. For the next week(s) however there should be of course (way) more things been done that can be shown during the meeting. 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good/Very Good

Feedback: It does not really seem that there is an unfair work contribution. A tip is to note down the todo's per person per week somewhere so someone can easily can be held accountable if they to not meet their deadlines. Lucca you were more up to date then last week, but are still not fully on track with what was discussed in lectures etc. It is no problem in this way as long as the team carries but if they get irritated then this might become a problem.
