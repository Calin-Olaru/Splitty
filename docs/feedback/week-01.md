# Get to know each other

## Goal 

• Introduce yourself (coding experience, interests, hobbies)
• Look into the template for the code of conduct, discuss the various points. (Website » Assignments » Teamwork » Code of Conduct)
• Make yourself familiar with the lecture schedule. Discuss assignment deadlines and talk about your planning.
• Discuss the project topic. Which features do you remember? Which ones do you find interesting? Which ones did you not understand?
• Remember: You are in charge, the TA is the “fly on the wall”

## Formative Assessment

During the meetings, I will each week fill in some rubric items. All items are supposed to be assessed on a scale from Insufficient, Sufficient, Good, Excellent.
Yes, the rubric in this first week is rather trivial.


#### 1) Self-organization

Of course the meeting was not yet self-organised but this will hopefully be the case from next week on! Overall feeling was good although you could be a bit more open towards eachother, I guess that will grow in the coming weeks.


#### 2) Suggested Topics

Are all topics that are important during the meeting covered or do you miss some? Luckily because I was in charge of the meeting all important point were covered ;)
