\section{Decision Making}
 In minor issues that do not affect the entirety of the product or the greater dynamic of the development group, a majority or consensus is not necessarily needed to push for the realization of a certain idea. In major issues or important disputes within the team, at least 5 of the 6 members of the development team must agree to the proposed changes. If such a majority cannot be achieved or specifics within said issue require it, the presence of Mike Segers will be demanded to schedule an end to the conflict, and hopefully bring about a quick resolution. If Mike is unable to provide a sensible solution, or it is unachievable, Sebastian Proksch, Ivar de Bruin, or Head Tas (Danae Savvidi, Rares Toader) will be consulted. Only in the absolute worst-case scenario will we escalate the situation further, to the Board of Examiners for example.
