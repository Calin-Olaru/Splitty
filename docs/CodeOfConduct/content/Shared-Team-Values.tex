\section{Shared Team Values}
As a team, we share a vast number of values, so we selected the most important ones to be included in our Code of Conduct. As we are working together, a good sense of teamwork is important, helping each other, being friendly, and giving critical feedback is a great value we all share. To avoid burdens by other peopleâ€™s lack of work, we value reliability immensely. Being reliable, finishing the assigned tasks on time, and being punctual to meetings makes the difference between a bad and a good teammate which is crucial for the future of the project.

Working hard is also a value we plan on keeping during this project, if everybody is dedicated, we will succeed. Unfortunately, no amount of hard work in a team makes a difference without proper communication, a vital value to the project. The more we communicate and discuss ideas the more in synchrony we will be with each other, and our way of working and solving problems, which in the period of the project will be the value which leads to the most efficiency. These are the shared team values we will be bringing to and implementing in this project.
