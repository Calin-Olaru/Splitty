\section{Ambition Levels}
We all understand the differences when it comes to what grade we will try to achieve. As a group, the goal is always working towards the best we can get. However, we know it is not always like that. The decided goal is an eight and a half, but if someone canâ€™t achieve it for personal reasons, they should be working for at least a seven. We believe that this grade is achievable because of the skill set we acquired throughout this year and past experiences, as well as our hunger for achieving highly.
