\section{Outside Collaboration}
While the mandatory meeting on Tuesday is essential to the teamâ€™s success, it is not enough to ensure progress and a good structuring of our work. If there are any talking points not discussed after the meeting, the members can meet outside if they feel they need to discuss them. Furthermore, at least one other meeting will be held during the week. In general, the meeting should be held on Friday, in person, either during the lunch break (12:45 - 13:30) or after the lectures (15:45 onwards).

If an offline meeting is not possible due to personal reasons, an online meeting will be held on Thursday (the hour at which the meeting is to be held will be agreed upon by the members for each meeting), on Discord, to discuss possible issues and to check in on the progress of the week up to that point. Any other meetings will be organized using WhatsApp.
