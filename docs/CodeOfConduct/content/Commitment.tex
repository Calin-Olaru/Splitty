\section{Commitment}
 Quality of work in the group will be observed through the simple application of a three-step system: for the individual in question, we will first ensure that every relevant objective in the Study-Guide for Object Oriented Programming Project (CSE1105) has been met. This includes but is not limited to the “Knockout Criteria'' (“Meaningful and visible project contributions throughout each of the seven project weeks etc”), their continued participation in meetings, and contributions to the project. The second step consists of checking whether the individual in question has respected their own set rules and regulations (Checkstyle in code, responsibility to deliver certain features, etc). The third step can only be considered once the individual has been a minute-taker or a chair at least once. Their performance in said roles will be analyzed based on the rubric distributed on Brightspace in the “Prepare and Run a Meeting” document. As such, it will be taken into account whether as a chair they led the meeting well, whether they were able to give a voice to everybody, whether they lingered an appropriate amount of time for each agenda item, etc. As a minute taker it will be taken into account whether they were able to lay out concise and correct notes after a meeting, controlled the flow of the meeting to not stray off-topic, etc. Additionally, once available, Buddycheck feedback might also be used when measuring commitment.
