\section{Planning}
In our team, planning is very important, it is the foundation of a good project. We will always plan before working on features and any big changes to the project will be planned. Planning gives us more time to focus on the rest of the tasks. So how do we plan? We will conduct meetings (Further explained in “Outside Collaboration”) where we will check in on everybody, see how the project is going, and resolve any issues or difficulties another team member might have. We will also decide the tasks and issues we tackle each week. Who does each task in the project is not decided by skill level, we all say what we prefer to do and divide the workload into equal parts. And the current week’s chair handles the submission of the assignments. 
\\\\
Each week we need to complete at the minimum, the knockout criteria, but preferably the goals we set, we are always thinking one week ahead and aim to be the most advanced team in the project. So all the issues we create are with this objective in mind.
\\\\
Lastly, we will always strive for the well-being of the team and that everyone passes. So, part of the planning is reminding ourselves of deadlines and important tasks we need to finish, so no one gets left behind and the project keeps progressing as intended.
